http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10840v2,"Many interesting datasets ubiquitous in machine learning and deep learning can be described via graphs. As the scale and complexity of graph-structured datasets increase, such as in expansive social networks, protein folding, chemical interaction networks, and material phase transitions, improving the efficiency of the machine learning techniques applied to these is crucial. In this study, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that have found great success in tasks such as node or edge classification and link prediction. However, standard GNN models have scaling limits due to necessary recursive calculations performed through dense graph relationships that lead to memory and runtime bottlenecks. While new approaches for processing larger networks are needed to advance graph techniques, and several have been proposed, we study how GNNs could be parallelized using existing tools and frameworks that are known to be successful in the deep learning community. In particular, we investigate applying pipeline parallelism to GNN models with GPipe, introduced by Google in 2018.",Analyzing the Performance of Graph Neural Networks with Pipe Parallelism,2020-12-20,"['Matthew T.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08145v1,"Semi-supervised learning algorithms typically construct a weighted graph of data points to represent a manifold. However, an explicit graph representation is problematic for neural networks operating in the online setting. Here, we propose a feed-forward neural network capable of semi-supervised learning on manifolds without using an explicit graph representation. Our algorithm uses channels that represent localities on the manifold such that correlations between channels represent manifold structure. The proposed neural network has two layers. The first layer learns to build a representation of low-dimensional manifolds in the input data as proposed recently in [8]. The second learns to classify data using both occasional supervision and similarity of the manifold representation of the data. The channel carrying label information for the second layer is assumed to be silent most of the time. Learning in both layers is Hebbian, making our network design biologically plausible. We experimentally demonstrate the effect of semi-supervised learning on non-trivial manifolds.",A Neural Network for Semi-Supervised Learning on Manifolds,2019-08-21,"['Alexander Genkin', 'Dmitri Chklovskii', 'Anirvan M.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10994v3,"Many representative graph neural networks, e.g., GPR-GNN and ChebNet, approximate graph convolutions with graph spectral filters. However, existing work either applies predefined filter weights or learns them without necessary constraints, which may lead to oversimplified or ill-posed filters. To overcome these issues, we propose BernNet, a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple but effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. In particular, for any filter over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, our BernNet estimates it by an order-$K$ Bernstein polynomial approximation and designs its spectral property by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the coefficients (and the corresponding filter weights) based on observed graphs and their associated signals and thus achieve the BernNet specialized for the data. Our experiments demonstrate that BernNet can learn arbitrary spectral filters, including complicated band-rejection and comb filters, and it achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.

We prove that for $n\ge k\ge 2$, learning the components of an $n$-vertex hidden graph with $k$ components requires at least $(k-1)n-\binom k2$ membership queries. Our result improves on the best known information-theoretic bound of $\Omega(n\log k)$ queries, and exactly matches the query complexity of the algorithm introduced by [Reyzin and Srivastava, 2007] for this problem. Additionally, we introduce an oracle, with access to which one can learn the number of components of $G$ in asymptotically fewer queries than learning the full partition, thus answering another question posed by the same authors. Lastly, we introduce a more applicable version of this oracle, and prove asymptotically tight bounds of $\widetilde\Theta(m)$ queries for both learning and verifying an $m$-edge hidden graph $G$ using it.",Tight query complexity bounds for learning graph partitions,2021-12-15,"['Xizhi Liu', 'Sayan Mukherjee']"

Based on this model, we propose a novel algorithmic framework called \textit{graphon autoencoder} to build an interpretable and scalable graph generative model. This framework treats observed graphs as induced graphons in functional space and derives their latent representations by an encoder that aggregates Chebshev graphon filters. A linear graphon factorization model works as a decoder, leveraging the latent representations to reconstruct the induced graphons (and the corresponding observed graphs). We develop an efficient learning algorithm to learn the encoder and the decoder, minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the model and data distributions. This algorithm takes the KL divergence of the graph distributions conditioned on different graphons as the underlying distance and leads to a reward-augmented maximum likelihood estimation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02753v3,"Comparing structured objects such as graphs is a fundamental operation involved in many learning tasks. To this end, the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, based on Optimal Transport (OT), has proven to be successful in handling the specific nature of the associated objects. More specifically, through the nodes connectivity relations, GW operates on graphs, seen as probability measures over specific spaces. At the core of OT is the idea of conservation of mass, which imposes a coupling between all the nodes from the two considered graphs. We argue in this paper that this property can be detrimental for tasks such as graph dictionary or partition learning, and we relax it by proposing a new semi-relaxed Gromov-Wasserstein divergence. Aside from immediate computational benefits, we discuss its properties, and show that it can lead to an efficient graph dictionary learning algorithm.

However, existing graph embedding techniques are unable to cope with fairness constraints, e.g., ensuring that the learned representations do not correlate with certain attributes, such as age or gender. Here, we introduce an adversarial framework to enforce fairness constraints on graph embeddings. Our approach is compositional---meaning that it can flexibly accommodate different combinations of fairness constraints during inference. For instance, in the context of social recommendations, our framework would allow one user to request that their recommendations are invariant to both their age and gender, while also allowing another user to request invariance to just their age.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12122v2,"Similarity graphs are an active research direction for the nearest neighbor search (NNS) problem. New algorithms for similarity graph construction are continuously being proposed and analyzed by both theoreticians and practitioners. However, existing construction algorithms are mostly based on heuristics and do not explicitly maximize the target performance measure, i.e., search recall. Therefore, at the moment it is not clear whether the performance of similarity graphs has plateaued or more effective graphs can be constructed with more theoretically grounded methods. In this paper, we introduce a new principled algorithm, based on adjacency matrix optimization, which explicitly maximizes search efficiency. Namely, we propose a probabilistic model of a similarity graph defined in terms of its edge probabilities and show how to learn these probabilities from data as a reinforcement learning task. As confirmed by experiments, the proposed construction method can be used to refine the state-of-the-art similarity graphs, achieving higher recall rates for the same number of distance computations.

There recently has emerged a number of approaches adopting a graph pooling operation within GNNs, with a goal to preserve graph attributive and structural features during the graph representation learning. However, most existing graph pooling operations suffer from the limitations of relying on node-wise neighbor weighting and embedding, which leads to insufficient encoding of rich topological structures and node attributes exhibited by real-world networks. By invoking the machinery of persistent homology and the concept of landmarks, we propose a novel topological pooling layer and witness complex-based topological embedding mechanism that allow us to systematically integrate hidden topological information at both local and global levels. Specifically, we design new learnable local and global topological representations Wit-TopoPool which allow us to simultaneously extract rich discriminative topological information from graphs.

However, leading graph contrastive learning methods generally produce views via random corruption or learning, which could lead to the loss of essential information and alteration of semantic information. An anchor view that maintains the essential information of input graphs for contrastive learning has been hardly investigated. In this paper, based on the theory of graph information bottleneck, we deduce the definition of this anchor view; put differently, \textit{the anchor view with essential information of input graph is supposed to have the minimal structural uncertainty}. Furthermore, guided by structural entropy, we implement the anchor view, termed \textbf{SEGA}, for graph contrastive learning. We extensively validate the proposed anchor view on various benchmarks regarding graph classification under unsupervised, semi-supervised, and transfer learning and achieve significant performance boosts compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",SEGA: Structural Entropy Guided Anchor View for Graph Contrastive Learning,2023-05-08,"['Junran Wu', 'Ke Xu', 'Shangzhe Li', 'Bowen Shi', 'Xueyuan Chen']"

Feature learning is important to deep multi-task learning for sharing common information among tasks. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to learn augmented features for deep multi-task learning. The HGNN consists of two-level graph neural networks. In the low level, an intra-task graph neural network is responsible of learning a powerful representation for each data point in a task by aggregating its neighbors. Based on the learned representation, a task embedding can be generated for each task in a similar way to max pooling. In the second level, an inter-task graph neural network updates task embeddings of all the tasks based on the attention mechanism to model task relations. Then the task embedding of one task is used to augment the feature representation of data points in this task. Moreover, for classification tasks, an inter-class graph neural network is introduced to conduct similar operations on a finer granularity, i.e., the class level, to generate class embeddings for each class in all the tasks use class embeddings to augment the feature representation. The proposed feature augmentation strategy can be used in many deep multi-task learning models. we analyze the HGNN in terms of training and generalization losses.

We propose a signal processing based inference model that allows for wideband frequency variation in the data and propose an algorithm for graph inference. The proposed inference algorithm consists of two steps: 1) learning orthogonal eigenvectors of a graph from the data; 2) recovering the adjacency matrix of the graph topology from the given graph eigenvectors. The first step is solved by an iterative algorithm with a closed-form solution. In the second step, the adjacency matrix is inferred from the eigenvectors by solving a convex optimization problem.

Existing GL methods are designed for centralized scenarios. However, in practical scenarios, graph data are usually distributed in different organizations, i.e., the curse of isolated data islands. To address this problem, we incorporate federated learning into GL and propose a general Federated Graph Learning framework FedGL, which is capable of obtaining a high-quality global graph model while protecting data privacy by discovering the global self-supervision information during the federated training. Concretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to the server for discovering the global pseudo label and global pseudo graph, which are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and complement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of each local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information of each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus alleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data among different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL significantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.",FedGL: Federated Graph Learning Framework with Global Self-Supervision,2021-05-07,"['Ziyue Xu', 'Weibo Hu', 'Zibin Zheng', 'Chuan Chen']"

However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges in a given graph. Here we propose GraphRNN, a deep autoregressive model that addresses the above challenges and approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to generate graphs by training on a representative set of graphs and decomposes the graph generation process into a sequence of node and edge formations, conditioned on the graph structure generated so far.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08184v2,"Graph generative models have been extensively studied in the data mining literature. While traditional techniques are based on generating structures that adhere to a pre-decided distribution, recent techniques have shifted towards learning this distribution directly from the data. While learning-based approaches have imparted significant improvement in quality, some limitations remain to be addressed. First, learning graph distributions introduces additional computational overhead, which limits their scalability to large graph databases. Second, many techniques only learn the structure and do not address the need to also learn node and edge labels, which encode important semantic information and influence the structure itself. Third, existing techniques often incorporate domain-specific rules and lack generalizability. Fourth, the experimentation of existing techniques is not comprehensive enough due to either using weak evaluation metrics or focusing primarily on synthetic or small datasets. In this work, we develop a domain-agnostic technique called GraphGen to overcome all of these limitations. GraphGen converts graphs to sequences using minimum DFS codes. Minimum DFS codes are canonical labels and capture the graph structure precisely along with the label information. The complex joint distributions between structure and semantic labels are learned through a novel LSTM architecture.

Similar to other types of deep models, graph deep learning models often suffer from adversarial attacks. However, compared with non-graph data, the discrete features, graph connections and different definitions of imperceptible perturbations bring unique challenges and opportunities for the adversarial attacks and defenses for graph data. In this paper, we propose both attack and defense techniques. For attack, we show that the discreteness problem could easily be resolved by introducing integrated gradients which could accurately reflect the effect of perturbing certain features or edges while still benefiting from the parallel computations. For defense, we observe that the adversarially manipulated graph for the targeted attack differs from normal graphs statistically. Based on this observation, we propose a defense approach which inspects the graph and recovers the potential adversarial perturbations.

To maximize system throughput, the resource allocation strategy that partitions the computation tasks of a stream processing graph onto computing devices must simultaneously balance workload distribution and minimize communication. Since this problem of graph partitioning is known to be NP-complete yet crucial to practical streaming systems, many heuristic-based algorithms have been developed to find reasonably good solutions. In this paper, we present a graph-aware encoder-decoder framework to learn a generalizable resource allocation strategy that can properly distribute computation tasks of stream processing graphs unobserved from training data. We, for the first time, propose to leverage graph embedding to learn the structural information of the stream processing graphs. Jointly trained with the graph-aware decoder using deep reinforcement learning, our approach can effectively find optimized solutions for unseen graphs.

In this paper, we propose a novel experience replay framework, called Structure-Evolution-Aware Experience Replay (SEA-ER), that addresses these challenges by leveraging the topological awareness of GNNs and importance reweighting technique. Our framework effectively addresses the data dependency of node prediction problems in evolving graphs, with a theoretical guarantee that supports its effectiveness. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art GNN experience replay methods on several benchmark datasets, as measured by metrics such as accuracy and forgetting.",Towards Robust Inductive Graph Incremental Learning via Experience Replay,2023-02-07,"['Junwei Su', 'Chuan Wu']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05651v1,"This thesis presents new methods for unsupervised learning of distributed representations of words and entities from text and knowledge bases. The first algorithm presented in the thesis is a multi-view algorithm for learning representations of words called Multiview Latent Semantic Analysis (MVLSA). By incorporating up to 46 different types of co-occurrence statistics for the same vocabulary of english words, I show that MVLSA outperforms other state-of-the-art word embedding models. Next, I focus on learning entity representations for search and recommendation and present the second method of this thesis, Neural Variational Set Expansion (NVSE). NVSE is also an unsupervised learning method, but it is based on the Variational Autoencoder framework. Evaluations with human annotators show that NVSE can facilitate better search and recommendation of information gathered from noisy, automatic annotation of unstructured natural language corpora. Finally, I move from unstructured data and focus on structured knowledge graphs. I present novel approaches for learning embeddings of vertices and edges in a knowledge graph that obey logical constraints.",Representation Learning for Words and Entities,2019-06-12,['Pushpendre Rastogi']
http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00808v1,"Learning the similarity between structured data, especially the graphs, is one of the essential problems. Besides the approach like graph kernels, Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance recently draws big attention due to its flexibility to capture both topological and feature characteristics, as well as handling the permutation invariance. However, structured data are widely distributed for different data mining and machine learning applications. With privacy concerns, accessing the decentralized data is limited to either individual clients or different silos. To tackle these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to analyze the GW discrepancy of node embedding learned locally from graph neural networks in a federated flavor, and then explicitly place local differential privacy (LDP) based on Multi-bit Encoder to protect sensitive information. Our experiments show that, with strong privacy protections guaranteed by the $\varepsilon$-LDP algorithm, the proposed framework not only preserves privacy in graph learning but also presents a noised structural metric under GW distance, resulting in comparable and even better performance in classification and clustering tasks. Moreover, we reason the rationale behind the LDP-based GW distance analytically and empirically.",Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy with Local Differential Privacy for Distributed Structural Graphs,2022-02-01,"['Hongwei Jin', 'Xun Chen']"

In this work, we generalize graph neural nets to pass messages and aggregate across higher order paths. This allows for information to propagate over various levels and substructures of the graph.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04726v2,"Graph contrastive learning (GCL) improves graph representation learning, leading to SOTA on various downstream tasks. The graph augmentation step is a vital but scarcely studied step of GCL. In this paper, we show that the node embedding obtained via the graph augmentations is highly biased, somewhat limiting contrastive models from learning discriminative features for downstream tasks. Thus, instead of investigating graph augmentation in the input space, we alternatively propose to perform augmentations on the hidden features (feature augmentation). Inspired by so-called matrix sketching, we propose COSTA, a novel COvariance-preServing feaTure space Augmentation framework for GCL, which generates augmented features by maintaining a good sketch of original features. To highlight the superiority of feature augmentation with COSTA, we investigate a single-view setting (in addition to multi-view one) which conserves memory and computations. We show that the feature augmentation with COSTA achieves comparable/better results than graph augmentation based models.",COSTA: Covariance-Preserving Feature Augmentation for Graph Contrastive Learning,2022-06-09,"['Zixing Song', 'Piotr Koniusz', 'Hao Zhu', 'Yifei Zhang', 'Irwin King']"

Without additional assumptions, this task is known to be NP-hard. Building on the minimum degree algorithm for sparse Cholesky decomposition, but utilizing DAG-specific problem structure, we introduce an efficient algorithm for finding such sparse permutations. We show that on jointly Gaussian distributions, our method with depth $w$ runs in $O(p^{w+3})$ time. We compare our method with $w = 1$ to algorithms for finding sparse elimination orderings of undirected graphs, and show that taking advantage of DAG-specific problem structure leads to a significant improvement in the discovered permutation. We also compare our algorithm to provably consistent causal structure learning algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, GES, and GSP, and show that our method achieves comparable performance with a shorter runtime. Thus, our method can be used on its own for causal structure discovery. Finally, we show that there exist dense graphs on which our method achieves almost perfect performance, so that unlike most existing causal structure learning algorithms, the situations in which our algorithm achieves both good performance and good runtime are not limited to sparse graphs.",Efficient Permutation Discovery in Causal DAGs,2020-11-06,"['Caroline Uhler', 'Chandler Squires', 'Joshua Amaniampong']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07266v4,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) mainly rely on the message-passing paradigm to propagate node features and build interactions, and different graph learning tasks require different ranges of node interactions. In this work, we explore the capacity of GNNs to capture interactions between nodes under contexts with different complexities. We discover that GNNs are usually unable to capture the most informative kinds of interaction styles for diverse graph learning tasks, and thus name this phenomenon as GNNs' representation bottleneck. As a response, we demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by existing graph construction mechanisms can prevent GNNs from learning interactions of the most appropriate complexity, i.e., resulting in the representation bottleneck. To address that limitation, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on interaction patterns learned by GNNs to adjust the receptive fields of each node dynamically. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm to alleviate the representation bottleneck and its superiority to enhance the performance of GNNs over state-of-the-art graph rewiring baselines.",Discovering and Explaining the Representation Bottleneck of Graph Neural Networks from Multi-order Interactions,2022-05-15,"['Fang Wu', 'Lirong Wu', 'Siyuan Li', 'Stan Z.

We generalize a previously known distance measure on graphs (Graph Diffusion Distance), thereby allowing it to be tuned to minimize an arbitrary loss function. Because all steps involved in calculating this modified GDD are differentiable, we demonstrate that it is possible for a small neural network model to learn edge weights which minimize loss. GDD alone does not effectively discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of wild-type vs. mutant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} specimens. However, training edge weights and kernel parameters with contrastive loss produces a learned distance metric with large margins between these graph categories. We demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple k-nearest-neighbors classifier on the learned distance matrix. We also demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis: once trained, we use our model to compute the distance between the biological graphs and a set of graphs output by a cell division simulator. This allows us to identify simulation parameter regimes which are similar to each class of graph in our original dataset.","Diff2Dist: Learning Spectrally Distinct Edge Functions, with Applications to Cell Morphology Analysis",2021-06-29,"['Chie Kodera', 'Magalie Uyttewaal', 'Diane Oyen', 'David Bouchez', 'Eric Mjolsness', 'Cory Braker Scott']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3383v2,"We investigate properties that intuitively ought to be satisfied by graph clustering quality functions, that is, functions that assign a score to a clustering of a graph. Graph clustering, also known as network community detection, is often performed by optimizing such a function. Two axioms tailored for graph clustering quality functions are introduced, and the four axioms introduced in previous work on distance based clustering are reformulated and generalized for the graph setting. We show that modularity, a standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these six properties. This motivates the derivation of a new family of quality functions, adaptive scale modularity, which does satisfy the proposed axioms. Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in the kinds of clusterings that can be found. Standard graph clustering quality functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special cases of adaptive scale modularity. In general, the results of our investigation indicate that the considered axiomatic framework covers existing `good' quality functions for graph clustering, and can be used to derive an interesting new family of quality functions.",Axioms for graph clustering quality functions,2013-08-15,"['Twan van Laarhoven', 'Elena Marchiori']"

Exploration of all information is crucial for good multi-view clustering. However, most traditional methods blindly or crudely combine multiple views for clustering and are unable to fully exploit the valuable information. Therefore, we propose a method that involves consistent and complementary graph-regularized multi-view subspace clustering (GRMSC), which simultaneously integrates a consistent graph regularizer with a complementary graph regularizer into the objective function. In particular, the consistent graph regularizer learns the intrinsic affinity relationship of data points shared by all views. The complementary graph regularizer investigates the specific information of multiple views. It is noteworthy that the consistent and complementary regularizers are formulated by two different graphs constructed from the first-order proximity and second-order proximity of multiple views, respectively. The objective function is optimized by the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method in order to achieve multi-view clustering.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13957v4,"Graph embedding techniques are pivotal in real-world machine learning tasks that operate on graph-structured data, such as social recommendation and protein structure modeling. Embeddings are mostly performed on the node level for learning representations of each node. Since the formation of a graph is inevitably affected by certain sensitive node attributes, the node embeddings can inherit such sensitive information and introduce undesirable biases in downstream tasks. Most existing works impose ad-hoc constraints on the node embeddings to restrict their distributions for unbiasedness/fairness, which however compromise the utility of the resulting embeddings. In this paper, we propose a principled new way for unbiased graph embedding by learning node embeddings from an underlying bias-free graph, which is not influenced by sensitive node attributes. Motivated by this new perspective, we propose two complementary methods for uncovering such an underlying graph, with the goal of introducing minimum impact on the utility of the embeddings.
